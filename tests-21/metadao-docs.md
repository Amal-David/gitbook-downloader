# Welcome to MetaDAO

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi

## Community ownership matters

Projects grow faster when they have an army of bagholders supporting them:

* Hyperliquid distributed 33% of its supply to its users. [Its perp volume 6xed](https://defillama.com/protocol/perps/hyperliquid).
* Yearn distributed 100% of its supply to its early users. [It subsequently rose from an $8M TVL project
  to a $6B TVL project without incentives.](https://defillama.com/protocol/yearn)
* MegaETH sold tokens in an Echo round to 2,900 people. [Its Kaito mindshare 15xed.](https://x.com/sandraaleow/status/1889658182458597445)

![](https://mintcdn.com/metadaollc/prgKP2kImec_ApFO/images/hyperliquid-volume.jpg?fit=max&auto=format&n=prgKP2kImec_ApFO&q=85&s=2fa1b1aa38aa824e6c5432e1974a3d24)
The above graph shows Hyperliquid volume over time. Can you see the point at which they launched a token?

## But most tokens are done poorly

There are many problems with the standard playbook for doing a token. These include:

* **Rampant insider dealings have led to a loss of trust**: hidden OTC deals, special insider payouts from the foundation, and the like have made many investors wary of tokens.
* **The tokens themselves have very little fundamental value**: because there aren’t any legal protections, nothing stops revenue from flowing to the team or a labs entity.
* **Frontloaded demand and backloaded supply contribute to structurally lower prices over time**: because they generally launch at a high FDV and most of their
  supply is vested over 2-3 years, these tokens need a large amount of incremental buy pressure to maintain their prices.

[Felipe Montealegre](https://twitter.com/TheiaResearch), a liquid token investor, describes these problems and others in his talk:

## MetaDAO is for founders who want to launch a token the right way

MetaDAO’s core principles are:

* **Fair launch early**: instead of launching at a high FDV, projects launch early with high-float ICOs so that they can grow over time.
* **Real ownership and unruggability**: the most important parts of the project -
  the intellectual property, the funds, and the ability to mint new tokens - are controlled by [market-driven governance](/governance/overview).
  This imbues the token with value and mitigates the risk of malicious teams rugging the treasury.
* **Pay-for-performance**: insiders unlocks are proportional to the premium over the launch price. This keeps teams and participants aligned.

While much of crypto concerns itself with how to maximally extract value over the short-term, MetaDAO is built from the
ground up for long-term founders and their communities.

# Are You Ready?

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi/how-launches-work/are-you-ready

## MetaDAO is built for early-stage, crypto projects

Eventually we’d like to support all kinds of businesses. But today we focus on crypto-native ones because they are most likely to benefit from [community ownership effects](https://docs.metadao.fi).
The ideal stage is when you have a working product / users but haven’t raised significant capital yet.
![](https://mintcdn.com/metadaollc/j5AeFtOF5GYU5Mpv/images/metadao-early.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=j5AeFtOF5GYU5Mpv&q=85&s=2e68382ed0fd49b913de4e61cbbf8d33)
It doesn’t need to be pretty - this was an early version of MetaDAO!

## You need to be prepared to build in public and sell your vision

If you don’t have a large community yet, that’s okay! Tokens are one of the most effective community bootstrapping tools.
But you do need to be able to **effectively communicate what you’re doing and why people should be bullish on you**. Your tokenholders will be globally distributed, which makes online communication - such as X articles and videos - key.
We recommend the following:

* At least 1 week of public lead up heading into the launch, with well-written articles and graphic tweets explaining what you’re doing and why people should be bullish on you.
* Monthly updates that cover the state of the business (including your KPIs) and what you’re focus will be.
* A Telegram group where you’re responsive to people that have questions for you.

Because your treasury will have market oversight, this communication is not a nice-to-have, it is 100% critical. **Failure to communicate your vision effectively may lead to capital being returned to tokenholders from your treasury.**

# The Colosseum STAMP

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi/how-launches-work/stamp

## Overview

The **STAMP** (Simple Token Agreement, Market Protected) is an investment contract created by [Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.com) that provides a clear path from raising private capital to launching a public token through MetaDAO.
[## Download the STAMP

Get the STAMP document and learn more at Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.com/stamp)

## Why the STAMP Exists

Traditional crypto fundraising instruments like SAFEs + token warrants create dual equity + token structures that lead to:

* Confusion for tokenholders about where value accrues
* Potential extraction by insiders
* Unnecessary costs and complexity

The STAMP solves this by making the **token the sole economic unit** — governed, protected, and aligned via the MetaDAO protocol.

Read the full motivation behind the STAMP in [Colosseum’s announcement](https://blog.colosseum.com/introducing-the-colosseum-stamp/).

## Who Is the STAMP For?

The STAMP is designed for two types of founders:

## New Startups

Founders with no existing legal entity who want to raise seed capital before their ICO

## Existing Cap Tables

Founders with equity structures and existing investors who need to migrate to a token-only model

## How the STAMP Works

## For New Startups

1. **Set up entity**: Create a Cayman SPC/SP entity through the MetaDAO interface
2. **Sign STAMP**: Investor signs the STAMP and sends funds (typically stablecoins) to your wallet
3. **Use funds**: Funds can only be used for product development and operating expenses
4. **ICO occurs**: Remaining balance transfers to DAO-controlled treasury along with IP
5. **Token delivery**: Investors submit a Delivery Notice to receive their tokens

## For Existing Cap Tables

1. **Create entity**: Set up a Cayman SPC/SP entity
2. **Sign STAMP**: Any existing SAFE, note, or convertible is terminated and replaced
3. **Clean migration**: Private investors receive tokens as specified in previous agreements
4. **Market protection**: All tokenholders receive governance protections via MetaDAO

## Key Terms

## Investor Reserve

Each STAMP investor is allocated a **fixed portion** of the project’s future token supply:

* Must be equal to or below **20%** of all project tokens
* Removes ambiguity and eliminates post-hoc renegotiation
* Provides predefined token entitlement that cannot be diluted

## Team Allocation

The STAMP specifies milestone-based team allocation:

* **Minimum**: 10% of total token supply
* **Maximum**: 40% of total token supply

This ensures an adequate percentage of tokens are available to ICO participants.

## Token Unlock

* Tokens enter a **24-month linear unlock** schedule once the Delivery Notice is received
* This aligns long-term incentives between investors and the project

## Benefits

## For Founders

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Clean structure** | Single token-based ownership, no equity complexity |
| **Cap table migration** | Existing SAFEs/warrants cleanly convert |
| **Preserved autonomy** | Maintain control while ensuring transparency |
| **Cost-effective** | Simpler legal structure reduces costs |

## For Investors

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Market protection** | MetaDAO’s decision markets protect token value |
| **Clear entitlement** | Fixed token allocation, no ambiguity |
| **Onchain governance** | Real ownership over treasury and IP |
| **Rug protection** | ICOs on MetaDAO prevent rugs and allow fair capital return |

# Getting Listed

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi/how-launches-work/create

## What we need

To get listed, founders need to provide us with the following:

* **Project name and description:** what the project is called and why someone should want to participate in its upside, both a 1-2 sentence version and a longer version - [here’s an example of the longer version](https://metadao.fi/launchpad/projects/DHW6DToYjhwknzVCDvZ6r7hSv7ZpGw9adEN8NvZuUpVh).
* **Token name and ticker:** for example, “Omnipair” and “OMFG.” We recommend using memorable and unique tickers.
* **Project image and (if different) token image:** what people will see on the MetaDAO site and on trading venues like Jupiter.
* **Minimum raise amount:** how much your project needs for you to go this path. If the project raises less than this amount the sale will be refunded. We recommend adding buffer for unexpected expenses and the 20% liquidity provision.
* **Monthly team budget:** how much the team needs every month from the treasury to operate normally. Spends that are larger than this need to be approved by governance. You can also configure this number later with governance. It can be no larger than 1/6th of the minimum raise amount.
* **Performance package configuration:** after the ICO, 10M tokens go to sale participants and 2.9M tokens go to liquidity. But you can also choose for up to 12.9M tokens to be pre-allocated to a performance package. This package is split up into 5 equal tranches, each of which unlock at 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, and 32x the ICO price respectively. There’s also a minimum time at which insiders can start unlocking, which must be at least 18 months from ICO date but can be longer if you wish. The price is taken over a 3-month TWAP, which extends the true date at which an insider can receive tokens for 3 months beyond the minimum date they can start unlocking.
  + **Example:** Alice pre-allocates 10M tokens to her project’s performance package with a minimum unlock time of 24 months out. The project raises $1m, setting an ICO price of $0.1 (1 million dollars divided by 10 million tokens). 24 months out, the token is trading 10x above the ICO price at $1. Alice initiates the TWAP and the price stays at $1 over 3 months. She then unlocks the first three tranches, equating to 6 million tokens. A year later the price is sitting at $2 and she unlocks another 2 million tokens.
* **Intellectual property:** the list of intellectual properties that the founder(s) will give up to the project’s entity. This includes but is not limited to domain names, software, and social media accounts.

## The process

Today, you need to complete the [project intake form](https://metadao.typeform.com/to/DxVVAxhC) to get started. Expect to hear from MetaDAO co-founder [Kollan House](https://t.me/kollan_house) and if you haven’t heard from us in two days reach out! [We’re working on automating this process right now](https://metadao.fi/metadao/trade-v5/7XMU3qTYrXe3yccr4qCLEPvmENGmC22MyMKMX9zJAi9x).
You should also join the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/+QTv0A_WAjcRiZWQx) to stay up to date with the progress and process.
Once we’ve put you in our system, you’ll show up on the site. You can then start the ICO whenever you want.

# The ICO

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi/how-launches-work/sale

## Overview

Investors get 4 days to commit USDC to a raise.
Sales have a **discretionary cap**, which means that the founder
can choose how much of the USDC committed goes to the project.
Allocations and refunds are given pro rata.
For example, if a project receives $2M in committments and the
founder caps the sale at $1M, everyone would get their share of
the tokens and half of their USDC back.
10M tokens are distributed proportionally among all participants.

## Why a discretionary cap?

The purpose of the discretionary cap is to allow believers to
participate while preventing projects from over-raising.
If you look at [other launch mechanisms](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2017/06/09/sales.html), they all have issues:

* Capped first-come-first-serve launches can be sniped
* Capped pro rata launches can be gamed - if you see a sale is
  2x oversubscribed, you may put up 2x the USDC, which makes it
  even more oversubscribed - which leads to poor UX for believers
* Uncapped sales are more likely to over-raise
* Dutch auctions are too complicated

## What happens when a sale is successful?

If a sale is successful, the following happens:

1. All USDC goes to a market-governed treasury.
2. The authority to mint new tokens is transferred to the treasury.
3. That treasury provides 20% of the USDC and 2.9M tokens to liquidity pools.
   In effect the project will buy back tokens below the ICO price and sell them
   above the ICO price.

The team can then spend their configured monthly budget out of the treasury.
To make larger spends or issue new tokens, they need to raise governance proposals.

## What happens when a sale fails to reach its minimum?

When a project fails to reach its minimum, everyone is refunded their USDC back.

## How are teams incentivized?

Teams can optionally decide to have up to 12.9M tokens (50% of initial supply)
allocated to a price-based performance package.
This package is split into 5 equal tranches: one that unlocks at 2x ICO price,
one that unlocks at 4x ICO price, and so on for 8x, 16x, and 32x.
The minimum unlock time on these tranches is at least 18 months from ICO date
but can be extended by the founder.
Teams may also forego this route and instead figure out incentives later,
[as MetaDAO did](https://metadao.fi/metadao/trade/BgHv9GutbnsXZLZQHqPL8BbGWwtcaRDWx82aeRMNmJbG).

# Introduction to Futarchy

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi/governance/overview

## First, some background

MetaDAO originally started as a governance project - since November 2023 we’ve run 96 proposals
for 14 organizations.
Decisions made on MetaDAO include:

* [Jito’s fee switch decision](https://metadao.fi/jito-dao/trade/CJW4iZPT14sVNzoc4Yibx1LbnY12sA75gZCP9HZk11UA)
* [Flash’s decision to start passing revenue back to stakers](https://metadao.fi/flash-trade/trade-v4/3kfEHobCtMn4rDCXmo2H735xX6oEacVN1DBuL41wj7az)
* [All of Sanctum’s governance decisions](https://metadao.fi/sanctum)

The difference between governance on MetaDAO and elsewhere is that there isn’t any voting, only trading.
This system of governance is called futarchy, pronounced few-tar-key.

## How does it work?

TL;DR:

* People trade in markets that correspond to “what would be the value of this token if this proposal passed?” and
  “what would be the value of this token if this proposal failed?”
* Organizations accept a proposal when traders think it will make the token’s value increase and reject them
  when traders think it will make the token’s value decrease

Here’s its inventor Robin Hanson to explain the concept:

## Why is it better?

Markets have a long track record of predicting the future better than alternatives. For example:

* [Prediction markets have historically beaten pollsters at predicting election results.](https://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf)
* [Orange juice futures markets have historically predicted the weather better than
  government forecasts.](https://www.asecib.ase.ro/mps/TheWisdomOfCrowds-JamesSurowiecki.pdf)
* [In 1986 when the Challenger Space Shuttle exploded over Cape Canaveral, it took the government
  4 months to identify Morton-Thiakol’s O-Rings as the root cause. The market had figured it out
  within 16 minutes.](https://maloney.people.clemson.edu/challenger.pdf)

![](https://mintcdn.com/metadaollc/prgKP2kImec_ApFO/images/challenger-reaction.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=prgKP2kImec_ApFO&q=85&s=8048b0b7f73612aa2be8e9945bf50e8c)

## Why does it matter?

We don’t know if decision markets are quite at that level of intelligence yet, but they appear
to already be better than token-voting at preventing capture.
Concretely, this means it is harder to rug ICOs when the funds are stored in futarchy.
Or, in the words of [Kevin Heavey](https://www.umbraresearch.xyz/writings/futarchy),
> Futarchy is such a radical improvement over majoritarian DAOs that even in its infancy it should already be ordained as the default governance mechanism, perhaps with training wheels like a security council to veto exploits.  
>   
> All DAOs that persist with token voting over futarchy should begin to feel increasingly uncomfortable, because in time it will be assumed that any DAO still carrying on this way is malicious or incompetent… If you want people to share ownership of your business, you either become a normal company with no governance token, or you bind your fate to futarchy and let the market decide.

# Creating Proposals

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi/governance/proposals

Anyone can create a proposal to a project. Proposals can:

* Spend USDC from the treasury
* Issue new tokens
* Update token metadata
* Increase or decrease the liquidity provided by the project’s treasury

Once a proposal is created, holders must stake tokens on it for it to
go live. By default, a proposal requires 500,000 tokens (5% of the ICOs 10M tokens)
staked on it for it to go live.
Staking is purely to prevent spam and doesn’t have lockups or risk of slashing.
There can only be one proposal live at once.

---


# Trading Proposals

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi/governance/markets

## Overview

Once a proposal has accumulated enough stake, the project takes half of its liquidity from the spot (e.g. META/USDC)
market and moves it into a proposal’s conditional markets.
Traders can then make *conditional trades* over 3 days. **Conditional trades are like normal trades, except they
revert if the condition isn’t met.**

## Example: Participating in the ORE Market

If you thought that ORE would have been worth more than $19 if they reduced their emissions by
40%, you could have participated in [this market](https://metadao.fi/ore/trade-v4/3PCPkFQQo7sU2DxpqnQNEttiyx1t5kByY2WPjCo1qLEZ):
![](https://mintcdn.com/metadaollc/prgKP2kImec_ApFO/images/ore-proposal.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=prgKP2kImec_ApFO&q=85&s=c1682394271328a3f0cd00be985a44d0)
If you believed that ORE would go to $30 if they adopted this change, you could have bought ORE in the pass market.
For example, you could have placed a trade of $1000 for 50 ORE ($20 per ORE).
Then, if the proposal passes, you would have bought ORE at $20. But if it fails, you wouldn’t have bought any ORE.

## How you can preserve & grow your portfolio by trading decision markets

## Case #1 - Bad Proposal

Suppose there’s a project, EXMPL, that has $1M in its treasury and a $1.2M
market cap. You own $10,000 worth of the token.
The founder just raised a proposal to send all of the project’s money to himself
so that he can go on a nice vacation.
The market immediately reacts to this information and the token shoots down to a
$900k market cap. But so far, no one has traded the decision markets, so it’s trading
$900k in both the pass and fail markets - what should you do?
One reasonable course of action would be to sell pass and buy fail. Pass is
overvalued at $900k if you think the token will go to 0 if the founder walks
away with all of the money. And fail is undervalued at $900k if you think that
the immediate next proposal will be to liquidate, netting you a nice 11% profit.
You’re prepared for either scenario.

## Case #2 - Good Proposal

Now suppose there’s another project called XYZ with $10M in revenues and a $100M market
cap. So it’s trading at a price-to-sales multiple of 10.
The founder just created a proposal to add a new business line.
You think that this business line will add $5M of revenue to the project, translating to
$50M in market cap.
Here, your course of action should totally depend on the prices of the decision markets.
If the pass market is already pricing the token at $150M, you shouldn’t take any trades.
But if it’s trading at $110M in the pass market, you probably want to buy. If it’s trading
at $200M, you probably want to sell.
And if you think that $100M is the fair value for the project if the proposal fails, you
would probably want to buy the fail market at below $100M and sell it above $100M.

---


# Finalizing Proposals

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi/governance/twaps

## TWAPs decide whether proposals pass or fail

The goal of futarchy is to accept proposals that increase the value of the project.
Unfortunately, you can’t just take prices at the end of the proposal because
those could be easily manipulated.
So instead, we use time-weighted average prices (TWAPs).

## TWAPs are lagged to mitigate the effects of manipulation

Normal TWAPs also have their flaws. For example, a Solana validator could
manipulate a TWAP by setting the price extremely high for a few slots.
If said validator controlled 1% of slots, they could force a proposal
through by 100xing the pass price during their slots.
We deal with this by using a special form of TWAP we call a lagging price TWAP.
In a lagging price TWAP, the number that gets fed into the TWAP isn’t the raw price - it’s a number that tries to approximate the price but which can only move a certain amount per update.
We call the number that gets fed into the TWAP an *observation*.
![](https://mintcdn.com/metadaollc/prgKP2kImec_ApFO/images/twaps.jpg?fit=max&auto=format&n=prgKP2kImec_ApFO&q=85&s=67d8e5e23a16d49efc525e876fc191f2)
To take an example, imagine that a market’s initial observation is $500
and it can change at most $5 per minute. If market is currently trading
at $550, it will take 10 minutes before the last observation reflects
the price.

## Thresholds make it slightly harder to pass proposals than to fail them

Futarchy is still new, and it seems prudent to bake in a threshold that makes
it harder for proposals to pass than to fail.
So for a proposal to pass, its pass TWAP needs to be at least a threshold
percent above its fail price. By default, this threshold is set to 1.5%.

# META Token Details

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi/token/details

## Overview

META is the governance and utility token of the MetaDAO protocol. This page provides comprehensive information about the token’s supply, distribution, and issuance mechanisms to meet regulatory transparency requirements.

## Token Migration

**Active Migration**: MetaDAO is currently migrating from the legacy METAC token to the new META token. If you hold METAC tokens, please migrate them to META.

[## Migrate Your Tokens

Visit the migration portal to convert your METAC tokens to META — no fees, one-way migration](https://v1.metadao.fi/migration)

## Migration Details

| Token | Mint Address | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **META** (New) | `METAwkXcqyXKy1AtsSgJ8JiUHwGCafnZL38n3vYmeta` | ✅ Active |
| **METAC** (Legacy) | `METADDFL6wWMWEoKTFJwcThTbUmtarRJZjRpzUvkxhr` | ⚠️ Migrating |

**Key Migration Info:**

* **No fees** — migration is completely free
* **One-way** — migration cannot be reversed
* **Multiple migrations** — you can migrate in batches if needed
* **Verification** — check your wallet after migration to confirm receipt

For developers, the migration contract is available at [github.com/metaDAOproject/token-migrator](https://github.com/metaDAOproject/token-migrator) and via the NPM package `@metaDAOproject/token-migrator`.

## Supply Information

## META Token Address

**META Mint Address (Solana):** `METAwkXcqyXKy1AtsSgJ8JiUHwGCafnZL38n3vYmeta`

## Current Circulating Supply

Real-time total supply is always available onchain and can be verified through multiple methods:

[## Solana Explorer

View live “Current Supply” directly on Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/METAwkXcqyXKy1AtsSgJ8JiUHwGCafnZL38n3vYmeta)[## Supply API

Programmatic access via our API endpoints](https://api-docs.metadao.fi/introduction)

## Onchain Verification (Solana RPC)

You can query the Solana blockchain directly using the `getTokenSupply` RPC method:

Copy

```
curl https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"getTokenSupply",
    "params":["METAwkXcqyXKy1AtsSgJ8JiUHwGCafnZL38n3vYmeta"]
  }'
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/supply/:mintAddress` | Complete supply info (total, circulating, decimals, raw) |
| `GET /api/supply/:mintAddress/total` | Total supply only |
| `GET /api/supply/:mintAddress/circulating` | Circulating supply only |

For detailed API documentation, visit [api-docs.metadao.fi](https://api-docs.metadao.fi/introduction).

## Maximum Supply

**No Protocol-Enforced Hard Cap**: META does not have a hard cap at the token-program level. In SPL tokens, a “hard cap” only exists if mint authority is permanently removed — in META’s model, the mint authority is controlled by governance, not a human operator.

**Key Points:**

* No hard cap is enforced by the token contract itself
* Supply increases are **only** possible via governance-approved issuance proposals
* There is no “silent” or off-chain discretionary minting — the mint authority is the governance program
* All issuance must be publicly proposed and pass the futarchy mechanism before execution

This design allows the protocol to:

* Fund ongoing development and operations
* Incentivize contributors and ecosystem growth
* Adapt to changing market conditions through community governance

All supply-increasing proposals must pass through the futarchy governance process, where market participants evaluate whether the proposed issuance would increase or decrease the token’s value.

## Initial Token Distribution

Projects launched on MetaDAO typically follow a high-float ICO model:

* **10,000,000 tokens** are minted at project launch
* Distributed through a fair launch mechanism
* No private sales or insider allocations at launch

## Issuance Mechanism

## How New Tokens Are Created

New META tokens can **only** be minted through governance proposals. The process works as follows:

1. **Proposal Creation**: Anyone can create a proposal to issue new tokens
2. **Stake Requirement**: 500,000 tokens (5% of initial supply) must be staked for the proposal to go live
3. **Market Trading Period**: Conditional markets open for 3 days where traders evaluate and participate in trading the proposal
4. **Automatic Execution**: If traders determine the issuance will increase token value, the proposal passes and tokens are minted

For detailed mechanics on how the minting process works, including timelocks and onchain flows, see our [Token Mechanics](/token/mechanics) page.

## Governance Controls

The futarchy system provides several protections for token holders:

* **Market-Based Approval**: Proposals only pass if traders believe they will increase token value
* **Transparent Process**: All proposals and their outcomes are publicly visible onchain
* **No Unilateral Minting**: No individual or team can mint tokens without market approval

## Transparency & Verification

## Onchain Verification

All token supply data can be verified directly on the Solana blockchain:

| Resource | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/METAwkXcqyXKy1AtsSgJ8JiUHwGCafnZL38n3vYmeta) | Live supply visible under “Current Supply” |
| [API Documentation](https://api-docs.metadao.fi/introduction) | Programmatic access to supply data |
| Solana RPC | Query `getTokenSupply` for the META mint directly |

## Regulatory Compliance

This documentation is designed to meet the requirements of the Korean Virtual Asset User Protection Act and similar regulatory frameworks. Key compliance points:

Supply Transparency

Real-time circulating supply is available via API at all times. There is no fixed schedule for supply changes - all changes occur through governance proposals.

Issuance Predictability

All proposals are publicly visible before trading begins. These proposals are broadcast onchain and via the website. The 3-day trading period provides time for market participants to react.

No Hidden Inflation

There are no automatic inflation mechanisms, scheduled unlocks, or team vesting that occurs outside of governance. All supply changes require market approval.

## Questions?

For additional questions about META tokenomics or compliance requirements, please contact the MetaDAO team through our official channels.

# Token Mechanics

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi/token/mechanics

## Overview

This page provides detailed technical information about how META tokens are minted, the proposal lifecycle, and the onchain flow of funds. This documentation addresses regulatory requirements for transparency in token issuance.

## Proposal Lifecycle

## Stage 1: Proposal Creation

Anyone can create a proposal that includes token minting. When a proposal is created:

1. The proposal is published onchain with all details publicly visible
2. The proposal specifies:
   * Number of tokens to mint (if any)
   * Recipient address for minted tokens
   * Purpose and rationale

**Public Visibility**: All supply-increasing proposals are publicly announced the moment they are created onchain. There are no private or hidden proposals.

## Stage 2: Stake Accumulation

Before a proposal can go live for trading:

* **500,000 tokens** (5% of initial 10M supply) must be staked on the proposal
* Staking is permissionless - any token holder can stake
* Stakes are returned after proposal is live for trading (no lockup or slashing risk)
* This prevents spam proposals from consuming governance resources

## Stage 3: Conditional Market Trading (3 Days)

Once sufficient stake is accumulated:

1. **Markets Open**: The project moves half its spot liquidity into conditional markets
2. **Trading Period**: Traders have **3 full days** to trade in pass/fail markets
3. **Price Discovery**: The market determines whether the proposal will increase or decrease token value
4. **Public Information**: All trading activity is visible onchain in real-time

**Investor Reaction Time**: The 3-day trading period ensures investors have sufficient time to evaluate supply-increasing proposals and react before any new tokens enter circulation.

## Stage 4: Resolution & Execution

After the 3-day trading period, the proposal is finalized using a **TWAP-based mechanism**:

**TWAP Finalization**: Pass/fail decisions use a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) with a lagging design to reduce manipulation. This ensures the final decision reflects sustained market sentiment, not last-minute price spikes.

| Outcome | Condition | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pass** | Pass market TWAP > Fail market TWAP | Tokens minted, proposal executed |
| **Fail** | Fail market TWAP ≥ Pass market TWAP | No tokens minted, proposal rejected |

**Execution is automatic and immediate** - once the TWAP calculation determines the outcome, there is no additional timelock. The governance executor performs the onchain mint instruction to the proposal-specified destination.

## Timelock & Grace Periods

## Is There a Delay Between Approval and Minting?

**No Additional Timelock**: Once the 3-day trading period ends and the proposal passes, execution is immediate. The 3-day trading period itself serves as the grace period for investors to react.

The timeline for a token minting proposal:

Copy

```
Day 0: Proposal created (publicly visible)
       ↓
Day 0-X: Stake accumulation period (variable)
       ↓
Day X: Proposal goes live, markets open
       ↓
Day X+3: Trading period ends
       ↓
Day X+3: If passed, tokens minted immediately
```

## Pre-Vote Announcement

**Yes**, all supply-increasing proposals are formally announced before trading begins:

1. Proposal creation is an onchain transaction visible to all
2. The stake accumulation period provides additional notice
3. APIs and frontends display pending proposals
4. Social channels typically discuss significant proposals

## Inflation Structure

## Is META an Infinite Issuance Model?

**META is not hard-capped at the token-program level.** In SPL tokens, a “hard cap” only exists if mint authority is permanently removed and cannot be re-established.

In the current model:

* No hard cap is enforced by the token contract itself (so “infinite issuance” is possible in principle)
* But issuance is **gated by governance** and must be publicly proposed and pass the futarchy mechanism before execution
* The mint authority is the governance program — **not a human operator**
* There is no “silent” or off-chain discretionary minting

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Hard Cap** | None at protocol level |
| **Scheduled Inflation** | None - no automatic token emissions |
| **Minting Authority** | Governance program only - not a human operator |
| **Dilution Protection** | Market-based - proposals that harm value are rejected |

## Why No Hard Cap?

The governance-controlled model provides flexibility while maintaining accountability:

1. **Operational Funding**: Projects may need to fund development, marketing, or operations
2. **Ecosystem Growth**: Token incentives can attract users and liquidity
3. **Market Discipline**: The futarchy system rejects proposals that would dilute value unfairly

The absence of a hard cap is offset by the requirement that all minting must be approved by market participants who have capital at risk.

## Onchain Fund Flow

## Where Do Minted Tokens Go?

When tokens are minted through a proposal, they are sent to an address specified **in the proposal itself**:

1

Proposal Specifies Recipient

The proposal creator defines the recipient address when creating the proposal. This could be:

* A specific wallet address
* A smart contract (e.g., vesting contract)
* The project treasury
* A multi-sig wallet

2

Address is Public

The recipient address is visible onchain from the moment the proposal is created. Anyone can verify where tokens will go before trading.

3

Tokens Minted Directly

Upon proposal passage, tokens are minted directly to the specified address. There is no intermediate custody contract.

## Is the Recipient Address Fixed or Dynamic?

**Dynamic per Proposal**: Each proposal specifies its own recipient address. There is no single fixed address that receives all minted tokens.

This means:

* Different proposals can send tokens to different addresses
* Investors can evaluate the recipient as part of their trading decision
* Full transparency on the destination of all minted tokens

# For Entrepreneurs

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi/benefits/founders

## Introduction

One way to frame MetaDAO is “a place for crypto-native enterprises to raise money that doesn’t suck.”
That is, if you need capital to build or grow your business, you have a few options available to you today:

1. Follow the standard path, selling token warrants to VCs and launching a token in 2-3 years
2. Raise venture capital and never launch a token
3. Collect creator fees from Pump / Believe / Heaven or a similar platform
4. ICO on Metaplex or a similar platform
5. Launch on MetaDAO

Of these five options, only the fifth is purpose-built for building a long-term crypto-native business.

## The standard path is bricked and will continue to get worse

The standard way of launching tokens (hyped TGE, paid CEX listings, 10% airdrop, Labs / Foundation / DAO, linear vesting, etc.) is not optimized for building a long-term business - it’s a playbook for extracting money from retail investors while evading securities laws.
If you try to use it to build a long-term business, you’re going to have a bad time:Some may believe that doing a venture round doesn’t lock you into this path. But we find
that once teams raise money, they feel pretty locked into it.

## Never launching a token is reasonable, even if it’s not maximally crypto-native

Some teams don’t plan to do tokens, instead accruing value to their equity as a normal start-up would.
We think this approach is reasonable. If you can raise money from investors who don’t expect a token, you should seriously consider it.

## Launching on a bonding curve is terrible

Recently, a few projects have launched on or considered launching on a platform like Pump, Believe, or Heaven. The main problems with these are as follows:

* You don’t raise much money - the median token only makes $10k - $100k in creator fees.
* These tokens don’t have any intrinsic value, and the market will recognize them as such. You may have lots of traders, but you will have few long-term holders
* Snipers will scoop up large percentage of your supply and sell onto your believers.
* “Hey, would you like to come work for our start-up for a below-market salary and 1% of the supply? Yes, someone was able to purchase 1% of the supply for $150, but what does that matter?”

## Normal ICOs can work if you have enough trust, do the legal work, and avoid the pitfalls of the standard path

Another option is to launch at a place like Metaplex. Essentially, a 2018-style ICO where you’re given discretion over the money.
The problem you’ll encounter is that historically many, if not most, of these ICOs rugged. This has led to wariness among serious investors. So you may be able to get short-term token flippers, but it’ll be harder for you to attract long-term holders.
But if you have sufficient trust, and are willing to put in the legal work to align the token and the business and also to avoid following the “low float / high FDV” playbook, then this can be reasonable.

## MetaDAO is *the* place if you want to align a community the right way

But if you want to align a community by launching a token and you don’t want to do a bunch of legal, smart contract, and marketing work, MetaDAO is today the place to go.
On MetaDAO you get:

* A valuable token, which leads to longer-term and higher-quality holders
* Provable transparency - noone will wonder whether you’ve “OTCed”
* To enter the arena early
* A mintable token - you won’t need to worry about running out of supply
* A potential community of early believers

It’s not a free launch - there are plenty of trade-offs, including the psychological effects of having a liquid token that can go down.
But if we were launching a new crypto project today, MetaDAO is the place we’d want to be.

# For Investors

Source: https://docs.metadao.fi/benefits/investors

## Overview

MetaDAO helps token investors in two ways:

* Mechanistic protection against treasury rugs
* Legal protection against revenue rugs

## Mechanistic protection against treasury rugs

On Solana in 2021 there were four big ICOs:

* **Parrot:** raised $85M, [the team walked away with $72M of it](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/21/defi-project-parrot-puts-fate-of-over-70m-treasury-prt-token-to-vote)
* **UXD:** raised $57M, [insiders walked away with $46M of it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VYv7qHD9kpfFeY_nBjT6jkqbA0HHf4w5gBVFRuN5OPU/edit?gid=1572994615#gid=1572994615)
* **Mango:** raised $70M, [the founders are suing each other for stealing from the project](https://x.com/dj_d_sol/status/1843666330429600216)
* **Aurory:** raised $108M, [the token is down 99.5% and it’s unclear where the money has gone](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aurory/)

On MetaDAO, all of the funds go to a market-governed treasury.
If a nefarious actor walks away from the project, or if the price drips below book value, anyone can raise a proposal

## Legal protection against revenue rugs

Famously, the [$30m](https://dune.com/Marcov/uniswap-revenue) Uniswap has made from its frontend is retained solely by Uniswap Labs and will likely never end up in the hands of tokenholders.
Less famously, the Unibot team built Trojan, which made [$206M in fees](https://defillama.com/protocol/fees/trojan), and decided to keep the revenue for themselves rather than integrating the $UNIBOT token.
Because of the legal entity created at launch, tokenholders could sue teams that misappropriate the project’s revenues or compel service providers (domain name registrars, social media companies, etc.) to transfer control of IP to a new team.
