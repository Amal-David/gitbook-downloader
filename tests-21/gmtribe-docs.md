# gm tribe!

Source: https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/

## What is gm tribe?

gm tribe is a new way of building distribution in a community-led way.

The way we discover and connect with brands and products is changing. Ads are out, and authentic voices are in. Ads are becoming expensive and ineffective in reaching consumers, often creating a poor experience. In contrast, community-led distribution is emerging as the most efficient and trusted source of influence. We are more likely to try a product or brand that our trusted sources, including friends or reputable influencers, talk about.

gm tribe helps you go to market with the power of communities.

## Why should I care about gm tribe?

At gm tribe, we believe each of your users and community members has an influence. We want to help you capture and leverage each community member and user's influence to help you grow.

You reward your biggest believers to spread your influence in the markets you care about. And your believers not only earn financial rewards, but also earn social recognition. We help you create a large, loyal marketing army.

## How do we measure the Impact score?

We have developed a proprietary LLM that scores each user and their post on social media in multiple context windows. The same LLM gives a score to each user for participating in a brand's growth campaign. The LLM takes multiple data points, including the user's social profile(who follows them, who engages with them, what she writes about, how much reach she gets for different types of posts) and the post data specific to a campaign(reach, quality of the engagement, quality of their post etc).

# gmtribe launchpad

Source: https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/launchpad/gmtribe-launchpad

> Credits: We have been exploring better token launch mechanism for a long time. Thanks for MetaDAO for inspiring us with the Futarchy driven token launch mechanism.

## Why gmtribe?

Community is the most powerful force to make a project successful. Tokens are the most powerful tool to gather an army of believers who help you win.

Most token launches fail in creating a lasting community due to

* airdropping to unaligned believers (farmers)
* launching late at high FDV creating exit liquidity for Founders or early backers and rare upside for their community.
* relying on trading fee as a way to get runway capital, which forces projects act like a memecoin optimising for trading activity than building their product.
* lack of alignment between project fundamentals and token
* lack of transparency in treasury management

## gmtribe helps you raise from your long term believers, who makes you win

* Fair launch, High float, no token unlock fear
* Predictable runway in your treasury from the raise, so you can focus on building and growing your business
* Outstanding return if you turn your project into a success. Gradual unlock of team tokens as project value grow
* Turn your backers into your true partners who help you win

  + They help you make right decisions with the power of market driven governance
  + They talk about you publically so you get distribution

# Token Launch and raise cycle

Source: https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/launchpad/token-launch-and-raise-cycle

## Getting listed:

Projects first submit [fundraise application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGEjOg_wjLEL2RuKkhWSeWWfpz-9qRHnucoea2Lnila_jvmQ/viewform) form with all details listed in [Get listed](/gmtribe/launchpad/get-listed)

Once you are approved by the gmtribe team, you get listed on the raise site.

## Raise start

Once approved, projects can set the start date for their raise. Once the start date is fixed, project appear on the gmtribe website. Users can start buying the project token on the Start time. A raise stays open for 7 days.

## Raise end

Once the 7 day raise deadline passes, platform stops taking new deposits in the pool.

If the total capital committed in the pool is higher than the target raise, project team can decide how much they want to cap the raise at. Everyone gets a pro rata share of the tokens based on their committed amount. And the rest of the funds get refunded back users based on the pro rata share of their share in the commitment pool. Everyone gets the same price for the raise.

If the total capital committed in the pool is lower than the target raise, the raise fails. And everyone gets refunded their committed fund.

## After a successful raise

All the funds raised goes to the market governed treasury.

20% of the raise amount is deposited into gmtribe Futarchy AMM along with 2M tokens.

Another 1M tokens are deposited into a UniV4 single sided position owned by DAO treasury.

Token minting and spending authority moves to market governed treasury.

# Why become an OG

Source: https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/launchpad/why-become-an-og

OGs are scouts who discover right ideas and right capital to back them.

**Scouts** are the backbone of "**Venture Capital**". **VCs** leverage their network to scout new deals and and make decision. Though some VCs like A16Z have a professional scout programs, the entire Venture capital functions on "who is introing/vouching for a founder".

Think of them as

* Portfolio founders like YC accepts applications based on referrals from their past founders.
* Existing investors intro'ing their founders to new potential investors
* Ex employees from a VC firm sending them recommendation for founders they meet

We are bringing OGs onchain to build a programmable YC. Onchain OGs opens up a programmable layer to perpetually recognise and reward OGs for each idea they back.

## How it works

1. Anyone can back the project with any amount and then can generate their OG card from the same wallet.
2. Each OG card comes with a referral link.
3. OGs earn XP based on how much capital came via them at which points of time.

## Benefits of being an OG

* OGs earn social symbol for scouting good ideas early, backing them and connecting them to new capital sources.
* It opens a programmable permissionless incentive layer for founders to attract OGs to back their projects.

  + Preferential order in token sales for OGs
  + Discounted cap for OGs
  + Reserved allocation for OGs
  + Retroactively rewarding OGs
* Social reputation: People will like to follow OGs on socials to capture signals early.
* Founders will be able to create unique ways to attract right capital to their projects.

* 7.2M Tokens unlocked at 8x of launch price
* 9.6M Tokens unlocked at 16x of launch price
* 12M Tokens unlocked at 32x of launch price

By purchasing $GM tokens (“Tokens”), you acknowledge and agree to the following:

---

## 1. No Guarantees

Tokens are provided strictly on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis. No representations or warranties of any kind—express or implied—are made regarding financial return, price appreciation, future utility, platform access, or the continuation or performance of any associated project.

## 2. Not an Offer of Securities

The Tokens do not constitute equity, ownership, debt, or any form of security. The sale of Tokens is not intended to be an offering of securities and shall not be deemed an offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction where such activity is unlawful.

## 3. Understanding the Mechanism

The Sale Contributions are open for 21 days. This Sale utilizes a decentralized funding mechanism in which all contributions are deposited into a smart-contract escrow. The Token supply is fixed, and the raise is uncapped.

Once the minimum funding threshold is reached or exceeded, the Sale is deemed successful and Tokens are allocated to participants. If the Sale is finalized by the founder(s), the founder(s) may, at that time, elect to accept any amount of funds up to the total contributions received, provided that at least the minimum funding threshold is accepted. Any amount accepted flows directly and exclusively into the on-chain treasury governed by futarchy-based mechanisms.

Any contributions not accepted are automatically refunded to participants in proportion to their respective deposits. Should the minimum funding threshold not be met, all contributions will be fully and automatically returned by the smart contract.

If the Sale is not finalized by its initiator within the designated period, the finalization function may be executed permissionlessly by any network participant. In such circumstances, the default behavior is to retain only the minimum funding amount and refund all excess contributions to participants in their pro-rata share.

By participating, you acknowledge that you understand this mechanism and have reviewed all available documentation describing the raise process and governance structure at: <https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/launchpad/gmtribe-launchpad> (NOTE: WHILE DOCUMENTATION AIMS TO BE ACCURATE, IT CARRIES NO GUARANTEE OF COMPLETENESS OR PRECISION.)

Upon a successful Sale: (i) all accepted funds are programmatically transferred to the protocol treasury; (ii) token mint authority is transferred to the treasury contract controlled by futarchy outcomes; (iii) treasury deployments follow the governance mechanism. The treasury may seed exchange liquidity under treasury control to support orderly trading; parameters may be updated by governance.

## 4. Final Sale

All purchases of Tokens made in connection with the Sale are strictly final and non-refundable once the minimum funding threshold has been met and the Sale is deemed successful. By participating, you acknowledge and agree that you will not be entitled to any refund, reversal, or compensation under any circumstances following a successful Sale, including but not limited to loss of value, market volatility, illiquidity, or inability to use or access the Tokens.

## 5. Legal Entity Formation

A legal entity will be established in connection with the launch of the protocol and to serve as the formal issuer of the Tokens and to support all necessary operational, administrative, and compliance functions. These functions include, without limitation, management of intellectual property, engagement with service providers, execution of contractual relationships, and fulfillment of regulatory or jurisdictional requirements applicable to off-chain operations. The entity is being created to provide legal personhood, liability protection, and a clear organizational structure for activities related to the project.

For the avoidance of doubt, this entity shall not have discretionary authority over any treasury funds generated through the Sale. All such funds remain exclusively governed by on-chain smart-contract logic and the outcomes of futarchy-based governance mechanisms. The establishment of the legal entity does not alter or supersede the programmatic governance of treasury assets.

## 6. Eligibility

By participating, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age, possess full legal capacity, are not a resident or citizen of any restricted or sanctioned jurisdiction, and that your participation complies with all laws applicable to you. You further represent that you are not acting for or on behalf of any sanctioned individual or entity.

You will not use VPNs, proxies, mixers, tumblers, or similar tools to circumvent geo-controls. We may request KYC/AML information and screen wallets and transactions to comply with sanctions and anti-money-laundering obligations. Certain features (including market interfaces) may be unavailable in some jurisdictions due to derivatives or event-contract restrictions. Access controls and product scope may change to comply with law and regulatory guidance. Do not transfer the Tokens to restricted persons/addresses. We may restrict front-end access or integrations to enforce compliance.

## 7. User Responsibilities

The interface is non-custodial. You control your private keys. We do not control or assume responsibility for third-party wallets, RPCs, explorers, exchanges, or bridges. Use at your own risk.

You bear sole responsibility for securing your wallet, private keys, and access credentials. You agree to conduct your own investigation and due diligence with respect to the Sale and the Tokens. You are responsible for all tax obligations arising from your participation and for ensuring compliance with applicable legal requirements. No responsibility is assumed for lost wallets, compromised keys, or failures to maintain necessary security measures.

## 8. Risks and Disclosures

You acknowledge that participation in the Sale involves substantial risks, including but not limited to total loss of contributed funds, severe price volatility, smart-contract vulnerabilities, blockchain network failures, regulatory developments, and risks inherent to futarchy-based governance. You understand and accept that the Tokens may become worthless.

## 9. No Financial, Legal, or Tax Advice

You acknowledge that no materials, documentation, or communications relating to the Sale constitute financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. Participation is undertaken solely at your own judgment and risk.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no individual or entity involved in the development, deployment, issuance, administration, or promotion of the Tokens or any related system—including without limitation their affiliates, agents, advisors, officers, employees, contractors, vendors and representatives—shall be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages of any kind. This includes, without limitation, losses arising from trading activity, market volatility, loss of data, loss of revenue, profit, or opportunity, smart-contract vulnerabilities or failures, technical errors or failures related to the Sale or the use of the Tokens, network congestion or outages, loss of wallet access, or reliance on third-party services. Any liability is limited to the minimum extent mandatorily required by applicable law.

## 11. Modifications to These Terms

These Terms may be amended or updated at any time with notice. Continued participation in the Sale or use of related interfaces constitutes acceptance of any such amendments.

## 12. Governing Law

The terms herein will be governed by the laws of the legal entity to be established for the purposes of the Sale.

## 13. Acceptance of Terms

By purchasing, committing, or attempting to purchase Tokens, you affirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms in full, and that your participation is voluntary and lawful.

<https://farcaster.xyz/linda/0xd4a92c1a>

## What types of campaigns can I run

You can run campaign in any combination to

* **grow your users:** you can ask the agent to track any smart contract function like swapping, providing liquidity, staking or anything.
* **grow your following:** ask the agent to weekly reward top 100 followers by their engagement with you
* **or grow your reach:** ask the agent to reward top people who reshare your posts.

Example: @gmtribe in 7 days reward $500 among people who reshare this post and swap using Elsa. https://farcaster.miniapp.xyz".

This will result in growing maximum reach of your miniapp while only rewarding people help you get reach but also used the app.

## How to setup prompt for an onchain action

1. Open [gmtribe miniapp](https://farcaster.xyz/miniapps/LShrpCZ9wXA9/gmtribe) on Farcaster/Base app and click on "Add Action"
   ![](https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1536730300-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F7e4gHO4oxUtMnDntrn2d%252Fuploads%252F56byQV96hat0XjPP9IGd%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D91285341-a464-4240-b68f-1f961bf27905&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=6c20090c&sv=2)
2. Set up a "Prompt Phrase" you want to use in your cast and paste the contract address with which users will be interacting.
   ![](https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1536730300-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F7e4gHO4oxUtMnDntrn2d%252Fuploads%252FVONm1wYiPJLbgpYV6kSh%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D1f39e642-0b95-4a1b-9aa1-23987b9d6d1c&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=4ae1be8a&sv=2)
3. Select the relevant "Function" or "Event" that you want users to complete. In case of an "Event", select the correct parameter which represents the user.
   ![](https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1536730300-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F7e4gHO4oxUtMnDntrn2d%252Fuploads%252FN4ZvKLH437dbmvemD1ZO%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D4753900d-3204-4d35-bdee-1251a6803668&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=b3689b82&sv=2)
4. You can add multiple actions for the same prompt. Once done, click on "Save Action".
   ![](https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1536730300-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F7e4gHO4oxUtMnDntrn2d%252Fuploads%252FwZUatzLMyygNwz7GtNl3%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dc8087938-0da0-4cef-8b1e-3c0fca7f5ea5&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=aefa5413&sv=2)
5. Now you can use your prompt in your campaign casts like...
   *In 24 hours, distribute 100 USDC among top 20 people who reshare this cast and* ***published a campaign****.*
6. Once you post, in few minutes, the agent will reply with a link to lock rewards. And once you lock rewards, in few minutes agent will again reply with the confirmation "rewards locked in" and your campaign will be visible in the gmtribe miniapp.

## What happens to unutilized funds

In some campaign types, you might not utilize all the funds you lock for the campaign. In those cases, during the reward distribution, all the unutilized funds are sent back to the original address which locked the funds.

For example: if you have asked the agent to distribute 10 USDC to each person who follows the campaign steps but only 5 people are eligible to earn rewards. Rest of the 50 USDC will be sent back to your original address which locked the funds.

## For campaign participants

## How to participate and earn

Just follow the instructions written in the campaign like resharing a post, quote sharing a post, liking/commenting a post, follow an account or completing an onchain action. Make sure to link the wallet address using which you completed the onchain action to your Farcaster account.

Once the campaign ends, the agent find out all the accounts who completed all the actions mentioned in the campaign and sort them by their influence score. Then agent picks the top accounts(mentioned in the campaign) and send them reward to your primarry Farcaster wallet directly.

## How are rewards calculated

Once the campaign ends, gmtribe agent find out all the accounts who have completed all the actions mentioned in the campaign and sort them by their influence score. Each account is given a influence score based on who follows/engage with them and adding influence score of each account.

Based on campaign reward criteria, the agent picks up the top accounts and distribute the campaign reward among them.

There are two ways campaign rewards are setup

* Flat reward per eligible account: like 10 USDC each to top 50 account who follow campaign steps. In this each account will get 10 USDC.
* Imact based rewards: distribute 100 USDC among top 50 accoutn who follow campaign steps. In this each account gets reward in proportion to their influence score.

## Which wallet did my rewards go to

By default, the agent sends rewards to your primary Farcaster wallet. If you haven't set the primary wallet, it send it to your default Farcaster custody address.

# ⛳Philosophy

Source: https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/join-the-founding-team/philosophy

Our vision and values are what align us over the long term. Our missions keep us progressing towards the vision. Our strategy helps us measure the value we are creating.

YOU can build, get recognised and get rewarded fairly in gmtribe as long as YOU

* believe in the vision and mission
* have the similar values

## Vision

Humanity will be better served with a social network whose backbone is **NOT ads**. Instead, its backbone is creating authentic, genuine, valuable information and distributing it to the right nodes(humans and sentients).

We believe this new type of social network will be 100x bigger than the existing silo social networks. It will be much more integrated into everything humans do, including trade, collaboration, decision-making, and innovation. We want to play our part in creating this new social network.

## Mission

To fulfil this vision, we believe the first step is helping brands distribute resources efficiently to humans and sentients that can spread the brand's value proposition to the right audience.

Think of it as what "ad networks" solve for "ads"(attribution and targeting) we solve for authentic voice-led distribution.

**Targeting:** Authentic voice comes from community members(people who believe in or use the brand). They communicate about the brand's offerings as they understand it the most.

**Attribution:** Attribution is measured in terms of how much visibility an entity brings to the brand.

We can do very granular targeting and attribution at scale because of the advancements in ZK and AI.

## Values

We are building an organisation that makes it easy for anyone to come and help gmtribe. For this to happen, these core value pillars help us.

* Team >> Individual
* Take decision, move fast > Stuck in debate
* Debate > Don't debate
* Open >> Closed room
* Make it scrappy >> Make it perfect
* Polite/direct/respectful >> arrogant/sarcastic/disrespectful
* Transparent

## How can you be part of the founding journey?

If you believe in the gmtribe vision and mission, share similar values and think you can help gmtribe progress, here is how to start.

1. Go through the responsibility where gmtribe dedicately needs help today.
2. If you want to make a new initiative, propose it to the group, illustrating the goal and how to achieve it.

gmtribe maximises incentives towards entities that take on and fulfil more responsibilities. We use a hierarchal organisational structure format to define incentives.

The objective of this hierarchal organizational structure is to make it flexible for people on what responsibility level they want to play. This hierarchal structure is intended to show leadership. To avoid confusion, we don't promote a boss culture; we believe everyone is free to take as much responsibility as they like.

# Incentive structure

Source: https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/join-the-founding-team/incentive-structure

## Background:

Before coming to the current incentive model, we studied and experimented with multiple ways to incentivise coordination in an open organisation. Our most popular work is [Jediswap](https://jediswap.xyz), one of the largest dapps on Starknet(80% market share on Starknet pre-airdrop). With Jediswap, we built the whole organisation without any VC money or a piece of legal paper. More than 50+ core contributors and 100s of passive contributors made Jediswap possible. We implemented what we learned from there and other DAOs' work to come to the current incentive model of gmtribe.

## Challenges of open organisations

With our experience building Jediswap, studying different DAOs and experimenting with different incentive models, we figured out key problem statements that we needed to solve to ensure we built a sustainable organisation.

An organisation must operate at high speed and be able to iterate the product quickly based on market hypothesis and go-to-market approach. However, as open organisations scale, they become less efficient.

* **Responsibility:** It becomes hard to know who is responsible for what.
* **Endless debates:** Because of loose details around the decision hierarchy, people get stuck in debates, and execution suffers.
* **Loose KPIs:** Without clear incentives based on KPIs, it becomes harder to align people with organisation goals. People start moving in all kinds of directions and suffer in execution.
* **Talent void:**

  + Removing non-performing people becomes harder because of political issues in the absence of KPIs, which makes it harder to attract talent who can perform.
  + People sometimes suddenly leave, and it cripples the organisation because the organisation doesn't incentivise people to take on more responsibilities voluntarily.

## Solution

We figured out that our incentive model needs to take care of these two blocks to avoid getting trapped into the usual DAO/community operating model.

* **Roles and responsibilities:** We need to clearly define various roles in the organisation and what are the expectations from those roles.
* **Reliability:** We need to know that a person taking some role and responsibility will keep fulfilling their duties till the foreseeable future.

## Ownership distribution based on Roles

To build a systematic incentive structure, we took inspiration from the corporate models that most successful internet companies (Facebook, Google, etc) follow.

We define different role levels and what are the expectations of those roles across various categories (Developers, Sales, Product).

Using self-review and peer review processes every quarter, we finalise what role each person fulfilled.

## Base weightage

We have defined a base weightage for each role, aligning with the market salaries for those roles at these companies.

## Founding Factor

We defined a founding factor curve for each role to incentivise early contributors. The founding factor is designed to benefit people at the mid-level role since, at the start, the org does not need managers but execution-level people.

![](https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1536730300-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F7e4gHO4oxUtMnDntrn2d%252Fuploads%252F6luKCUOAfans9W8k55wY%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D6514f3c0-fcd3-4cdf-99d9-0ec4347f5a7c&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=30919251&sv=2)

## Monthly ownership allocation

Every month 2% of token supply is distributed among all team members. This 2% is divided among all individuals based on their total weightage (base weightage \* founding factor).

An individal's allocation = (base weightage \* founding factor)\*Monthly allocation/Sum(everyone's base weightage\* founding factor)

## Vesting schedule to incentivise commitment

Each monthly allocation of an individual gets into their vesting schedule.

Their monthly allocation gets vested for the next 12 months. All unvested tokens go back to the treasury.

For example, if you got a 12,000 tokens allocation in Jan.

If you continue to operate in your role for February, March, and April, you can claim 1000 tokens in February, March, and April. Since you stopped operating in your role in April, your unvested tokens(9000) go back to the organisation's treasury so that the organisation can use those tokens to incentivise people to fill the gap you created.

*Note: In the above example, you still get separate allocations in Feb, March and April with their own vesting schedule, just like for the Jan's allocation.*

We have created a simulation environment to see how ownership evolves with different additions/subtractions of people in the organisation.

# Request for roles (RFR)

Source: https://gmtribe.gitbook.io/gmtribe/join-the-founding-team/request-for-roles-rfr

At gmtribe, we have an open organisational structure. That means each person can choose at what level they want to play.

`Higher the level ⇒ More ownership taken ⇒ More ownership earned`

[Incentive structure](/gmtribe/join-the-founding-team/incentive-structure)

Below are the minimum-level voids we want to fill for our team. As long as you fulfil the responsibilities of this role, gmtribe thrives. But you don't have to stop there. If you want, you can play at a higher level and thus should be rewarded more.

`If you want to fill any of these voids, please email us at rohit@gmtribe.xyz`

## Lead frontend engineer (L6)

gmtribe is a consumer-first product that uses many complex technologies on the backend, including crypto, ZK and AI. We want to ensure we create delightful experiences for users. However, it is a challenging task since using ZK and AI is pretty new, and how consumers can get their benefits without understanding these technologies could be tricky.

We need someone to take end-to-end ownership of the front-end work at gmtribe. It means leading the vision of how users will interact with us, figuring out what problems they might be facing today, and how we can improve the experience.

You will be given total autonomy.

## Lead designer (UI + UX) (L5)

gmtribe is primarily a consumer-first product that uses many complex technologies on the backend, including crypto, ZK and AI. But at the same time, we have a business-side interface where brand marketers create marketing campaigns. We want to ensure we create delightful experiences for both types of users.

We need someone to spend time understanding how users(consumers and brand marketers) use the product, figuring out their problems, and developing the right user experience and design to improve their experience.

You will be given total autonomy.
